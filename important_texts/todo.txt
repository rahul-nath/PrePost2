1) feature vectors
2) Weka needs data in ARFF (Attribute Relation File Format)
   (attribute-value pair is a feature; "height : 5'6'' ")
   final attribute is the thing you're trying to predict;
   the default class you're trying to predict (it will be nominal)
   in curly brackets put what every possible class (two: either precond
   ition or not)

   DATA needs the values of the feature (each line is a feature
   vector with a line)

3) In the paper, include a description of successes and failures;
   what are the fundamental results. Don't try to sell her on what's
   good. Need to be critical of you've done; an honest view of what
   the next steps would be. 

Meeting at 2pm on Monday, Wednesday; 1pm on Thursday
