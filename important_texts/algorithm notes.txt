algorithm notes
Use case: Autonomous agents learning from instruction manuals; saves cost of programming
instructions; just have the robot "read" the manual, or rather, the action sequences,
just like one would do when they follow instructions on how to build a cabinet from IKEA or something.

Want to return a tuple of the learned static precondition with the original action's objects as parameters
and the original object with its parameters. LOCM matches the action heading against examples sequences to 
derive the static precondition (if it exists)

One problem is knowing when a static precondition is necessary. This depends on
- the rules of the game
- the tendencies of the environment (so the percept sequence of the agent)

Another problem: How do I get them back into the algorithm?
- By having LOCM wait for the input from PrePost+

- need an appendix for
querys made
candidate words their pmis and chi squared
features vectors 

freq 8
chi squared 7, and get the first value of the tuple
