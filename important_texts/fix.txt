USE PICKLE TO STORE DOCS AS CLEAN, STUPID SHIT FREE LISTS
THEN, IN DISTANCE BASED STUFF, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS READ IT IN
AND THE INDICES WILL REFER TO THE WORD NUMBER

and need to store shit as .p files


problems:
- check for existence of file only once and pass a boolean after
- internalization bottle neck
- don't know what text file belongs to what action/objects; need to label
- need to get rid of all the existing docs; they are effectively useless.

- save the action name, objects, and link to the top of each file
- when you read them in, save the first two lines (the link, and then the action/objects respectively)
- add the link to the link_list (don't keep the saved links; just add them as you go)
- save the action to the current action and objects to objects pages
- before you start making new queries, check if there exists a doc 0; if there does, then
  read in all the docs until there does not exist a doc with the next number; then, set
  the next number as the value of total docs (including 0th doc)
- only do 5 querys at a time; once you read in all the existing docs and store them internally,
  start the depth at total docs and increment by 5
- abstract out the process of storing internally

My purposes:

Non-volatile memory or secondary storage or ROM/Hard-drive/disk memory is
what I have been calling "storing externally" or "storing as text files"

Volatile memory or primary storage or RAM memory is what I have been calling
"storing internally" or "storing as docs"


- remove mathematica -> takes up half my damn boot disk
